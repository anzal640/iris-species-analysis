## Heart Disease Analysis Project

I've been working on this dataset to see what actually correlates with heart disease. It's a small but interesting dataset with 303 patients.

What's inside:
The Data: I used the heart-disease.csv file which tracks 14 different health factors.

The Analysis: I spent time cleaning the data and making some charts with Matplotlib and Seaborn to see how things like age and blood pressure play a role.

The Tools: I did all the work in Google Colab using Python, Pandas, and I've imported Sklearn to get ready for some machine learning later on.

My Conclusions:
After looking at the blood pressure distributions and patient ages, it's pretty clear that you can't just look at one metric to predict heart health. It’s a combination of several different factors.

To run it:
Just open the heart_disease_analysis.ipynb file in Colab and make sure you have the CSV file uploaded to your environment.
